Hello , I am seeking movies to watch . I like classics , but I will also watch new films . Alright , have you seen @96878 and @79421 I have not seen them . What kind of movies are they ? I 'm still waiting for Machete in space The best kind with a title like @96878 , it sounds too bloody for me . Is it gory ? Great for movie night What 's it about ? sure , but it 's worth the watch love , hate , revenge betrayal action commedy you 'll love it Is it terrible ? I like bad-good movies , like @78267 Maybe you would enjoy something less bloody like @133842 I 'm not find of the mediocre . Good or bad , you know & gt ; I mean not FOND of . What 's @133842 like ? It reminded me of @178950 In what way ? Would n't think they are similar but I think some of the voices sound the same .

Hey ! HI What kind of movies are you looking for ? Do you recommend any good children 's movies ? One of my favorites is @82894 . Are you looking more for boys or girls movies ? I have a daughter but she likes everything . I have n't seen Frozen yet . I was annoyed at how commercialized it became right away . My boys are the same way they actually love @180005 and yes I agree about eh commercialization but it is still a good movie I 'll have to check it out maybe . We have n't seen My Little Pony yet . One that is rather new and really good is @122604 it has sad moments though She loves @162647 and @94078 I love those movies total kid at heart lol Me too . I always like to watch movies with happy endings .

Hi i like movie about cars like @123629 and @134157 Wow , those go back a long long time ! or any recent car film and hi , how are you doing today ? good , I like stunts , any movie with car stunts like @151453 , this one was funny alright , well I 'm going to suggest a couple of films but they will be different genres since it seems like you have diverse film tastes ! as long as there are stunts in it I am happy it 's VERY risque but has an all star cast like @123629 and a comedy and that 's @99910 small car chase but very madcap This one was funny , lots of physical humor , that count as stunts , good suggestion @112069 was really good

Hello . What can I help you find ? Hi ! I like romantic comedies , some action too . @106388 is pretty great . Have you seen @173253 . It always reminds me of @106388 I 've heard of it . What is it about ? It is a fantasy about a couple looking for a fallen star . It is pretty humorous . Sounds good . What else can you recommend ? Have you seen @163090 . It was n't meant to be a comedy or a romance but it has a bit of both and is really fun to watch I have n't seen that one . What happened in that one ? Sean Connery and Katherine Zeta-Jones . An insurance adjuster chasing an art thief and falling in love . Nice ! Anything else ? @188302 with Drew Barrymore also has that princess bride feel It is a different take on Cinderella I think I did see that one . It was good . If you like Drew @115908 fall into the romantic comedy catagory Yeah , that was cute too . Thanks for the suggestions ! Goodbye .
